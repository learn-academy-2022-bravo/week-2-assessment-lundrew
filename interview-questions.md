# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: The parameter is the placeholder inside a function. When the argument is passed, the argument is connected to the parameter and we can then create actions on the parameter within the function.  

  Researched answer:A parameter is the variable that is listed in the parentheses of the function, and when something is passed through the console.log (which is the argument) it is sent through that function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The required parameters are the ones that need to be pushed from the argument. When an argument is passed, the map() function will alter the original array. 

  Researched answer: the array method called map(), calls a specified function for every array element and then creates a new array with that. This map() method does not change anything to the original array but creates a new array. We use this if we want to execute a different function to an array or an element within that array. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map accesses all the elements within an array and filter, filters out specific elements in an array. 

  Researched answer: The filter() array method will filter out any unwanted elements within that array. The map() array method will transform every element in an array individually. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a code block that makes an action and can be used multiple times on different data. A method is a built in function that can be used within a function. 

  Researched answer: A method is a function within an object or function.  If there is no method within the object, it is just an object. If there is no object surrounding the method, then it is a function. When a function is placed within the scope of an object, it is considered a method. 



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is when you can take a property from an object and apply it to a new variable. 

  Researched answer: Destructuring is when you take the properties from an object or the indexes of an array to separate them and to then create specific variables.

  object(contains properties) --> destructure(property) --> create new variable(containing same property)



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is related to the arrangement of code and how variables are accessed. 

  Researched answer: Hoisting is the process of moving the declaration of variables, functions or classes to the top of their scope prior to the execution of the code. It gives us the advantage that wherever the variables etc.. are declared, they are then moved to the top of their scope and does not matter if their scope is global or local. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is when there is a class created but we want to use that class as a template for newly created classes. This is like a parent child relationship, where the child class is inheriting traits from the parent class. You can create multiple child classes based off of the parent class. 

2. React: React. js is an open source Javascript library that is used for building user interfaces mainly for single page applications. React also gives us the option to reuse UI components. 

3. React state: With React state, we can visually change the value of a variable that already has a value. 

4. React lifecycle methods: The lifecycle methods contain "Mounting lifecycle methods", "Updating lifecycle methods", "Unmounting lifecycle methods", and the "Error handling lifecycle methods". 

Mounting: adding nodes to the DOM
Updating: alters existing nodes in the DOM
Unmounting: removes nodes from the DOM
Error Handling: verifys that the code works and is bug free.

5. DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a platform interface that allows you to change the content, structure or style of a website. The DOM consists of the Document you see on a webpage, the objects that elements within the code, and the model which is the hierarchy of tags (a tree structure).
